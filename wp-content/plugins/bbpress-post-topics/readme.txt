Tested up to: 6.8

Replace the comments on your WordPress blog posts with topics from an integrated bbPress install

== Description ==

Adds an option to the Discussion meta box to use a bbPress topic instead of WordPress comments, and displays that topic beneath the post on your site.

You can let the plugin create a new topic for you in the forum of your choice, or specify an existing topic to attach to the post.
A topic can be attached to as many posts as you'd like, but only one topic can currently be attached to a post.

1. Extract the plugin archive 
1. Upload plugin files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
